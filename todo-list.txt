1.1. Clean the massive dataset
    - >datasets > Covid-19 Nursing Home data sets:
        - each csv is one year
        - lets try to clean the data so we have data on each nursing home throughout the entire 3 years. 
    - We need to combine the massive datasets
        then, remove unwanted columns
            then, indicate null values (NaN)
                then, remove that don't pass the quality assurance indicator.

1.2. Find linear relationships in the data 
    -We need to find linear relationships to implement multivarible regression models.
    -This would also let us know what columns we will use.
